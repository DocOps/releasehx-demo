  # NOTE:
  # This file is a source for generating and testing demo payloads for using with ReleaseHx.
  # This file is proper RHYML; we use it to reverse engineer API payloads from JIRA, GH Issues, etc.
  # All change records except IMP-999 should have a release_note_needed indicator in their
  #  JSON payload, depending on whether the IMS-side setup is to use labels or checkboxes in the 
  #  body/description field.
  # If release notes are sourced in the description/body, they should contain developer-oriented 
  #  content from the original issue text, followed by demarcation like:
  #  '\n\n## Draft Release Note\n\n' followed by the content of note
